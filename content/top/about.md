Iâ€™ve been architecting, designing and implementing distributed applications since 1991, initially in client-server applications written in C++ and Java deployed to UNIX/LINUX platforms. Beginning in 2011 I began working with highly-scaleable/highly-available microservice applications using Java, Erlang, and since 2015, Go. This blog series is intended to share my experience in these areas. 

Some of the articles will be focused on how to accomplish specific tasks like setting up a Raspberry Pi cluster. Unlike many posts I've read on these types of topics, I will also describe what certain commands do, how they're used, and why they're being used. Where multiple methods for accomplishing something are possible I explain why I chose a particular way.

Other articles will be focused more on software engineering topics such as important attributes of distributed applications or how to design readable, maintainable, and performant code.
